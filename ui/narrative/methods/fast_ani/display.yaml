    <p>FastANI is developed for fast alignment-free computation of whole-genome Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI). ANI is defined as mean nucleotide identity of orthologous gene pairs shared between two microbial genomes. FastANI supports pairwise comparison of both complete and draft genome assemblies.</p>

    <p>Its underlying procedure follows a similar workflow as described by Goris et al. 2007. However, it avoids expensive sequence alignments and uses Mashmap as its MinHash based sequence mapping engine to compute the orthologous mappings and alignment identity estimates. Based on our experiments with complete and draft genomes, its accuracy is on par with BLAST-based ANI solver and it achieves two to three orders of magnitude speedup.</p>

    <p> Therefore, it is useful for pairwise ANI computation of large number of genome pairs. More details about its speed, accuracy and potential applications are described here: <a href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/11/27/22534' target='_blank'>"High-throughput ANI Analysis of 90K Prokaryotic Genomes Reveals Clear Species Boundaries"</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Paper abstract:</em> A fundamental question in microbiology is whether there is a continuum of genetic diversity among genomes or clear species boundaries prevail instead. Answering this question requires robust measurement of whole-genome relatedness among thousands of genomes and from diverge phylogenetic lineages. Whole-genome similarity metrics such as Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) can provide the resolution needed for this task, overcoming several limitations of traditional techniques used for the same purposes. Although the number of genomes currently available may be adequate, the associated bioinformatics tools for analysis are lagging behind these developments and cannot scale to large datasets. Here, we present a new method, FastANI, to compute ANI using alignmentfree approximate sequence mapping. Our analyses demonstrate that FastANI produces an accurate ANI estimate and is up to three orders of magnitude faster when compared to an alignment (e.g., BLAST)- based approach. We leverage FastANI to compute pairwise ANI values among all prokaryotic genomes available in the NCBI database. Our results reveal a clear genetic discontinuity among the database genomes, with 99.8% of the total 8 billion genome pairs analyzed showing either >95% intra-species ANI or <83% inter-species ANI values. We further show that this discontinuity is recovered with or without the most frequently represented species in the database and is robust to historic additions in the public genome databases. Therefore, 95% ANI represents an accurate threshold for demarcating almost all currently named prokaryotic species, and wide species boundaries may exist for prokaryotes.</p>

    <p><b>NOTE:</b> No ANI output is reported for a genome pair if ANI value is much below 80%. Such case should be computed at amino acid level.</p>
